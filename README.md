# **Enhancing Network Security Awareness: Visual Cyber Threat Analysis**
The goal of this project is to develop effective visualization techniques for the KDD Cup 1999 Data.

## **Abstract**
Cybersecurity professionals and researchers often deal with complex datasets related to network intrusions and security incidents. The goal of this project is to develop effective visualization techniques for the KDD Cup 1999 Data. These datasets contain information about network intrusions and normal activities, and visualization of this data helps obtain valuable insights about network intrusions. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and visualizing clusters of attack types using k-means, bar graphs, and pie charts, etc to show the number of
attacks of each type visually. This data is very useful for
obtaining valuable insights about intrusions since the attacks are
visually represented for analysis. A standalone application is
developed using QT Framework to interact with the
visualization.

## **Methodology**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- K-Means Clustering
- Bar Graphs

## **Conclusion and Future Work**
The application of diverse visualization techniques on the
KDD Cup 1999 dataset has yielded valuable insights into the
realm of network intrusion detection. Through the lens of
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), the inherent
complexities within the dataset have been distilled into
visually comprehensible representations, enabling the
identification of distinct patterns and clusters. K-Means
clustering further enhances our understanding by grouping
similar instances, shedding light on the diverse nature of
network activities. Bar graphs and pie charts contribute a
concise visual summary of the distribution of various attack
types, offering cybersecurity professionals an accessible
means of prioritizing threats.
Moreover, the integration of the QT Framework into a
standalone application has significantly enriched the user
experience, providing a seamless interface for exploring and
interacting with the visualizations. This project not only
exemplifies the power of advanced visualization techniques in
cybersecurity analysis but also underscores the importance of
accessibility and user-friendly interfaces in facilitating
informed decision-making.
As we move forward, the insights gained from these
visualizations will serve as a solid foundation for the
development and implementation of robust network intrusion
detection systems. By combining the strengths of data
visualization with advanced machine learning techniques,
future endeavors in this domain are poised to make significant
strides in bolstering network security and mitigating the
evolving landscape of cyber threats. The amalgamation of
cutting-edge visualizations and sophisticated frameworks
positions this project at the forefront of knowledge discovery
and data mining in the field of cybersecurity.
Adding functionality for more types of visualizations and
improving the dataset by doing better preprocessing to
discover hidden features can be done in future.
